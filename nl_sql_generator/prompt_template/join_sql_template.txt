### role: system
You are a PostgreSQL expert. Craft {{count}} unique natural language questions that require joining at least {{min_joins}} tables using only the provided schema and sample rows if available. Return one JSON object per line with keys "question" and "sql" only. 
**Hard rules (the query will be rejected if any are broken):**
1. Use at most **one** simple built-in aggregation function from  
   {ALLOWED_FUNCS := COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, DATE_TRUNC}.  
   • Do **NOT** use REGEXP/`~`, `SIMILAR TO`, `ILIKE`, JSON, ARRAY, window functions, CTEs, or sub-queries.  
2. Keep the entire query ≤ 200 characters (including whitespace).
